# Vocabulary - Focus on Virtualization

## Terms requested by the audience

Got a grand total of **TWO** terms requested. Both by the same person.

_Who(m)ever you are, thank you._

* containerization
* cloud infrastructure

## My roundabout way of explaining...

* What is a computer?
* What is a virtual machine?
* What is the cloud?
* What is a container?
* What do we mean by the word "infrastructure"?
* And finally, my favorite topic: _abstraction_

## Other questions (if there's time)

* ???
